     just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 
    to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved.  <span style="color: burlywood;">Ephesians 1:3-6</span></marquee>
